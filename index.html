                HeartBeats is a workout playlist generator powered by the spotify API.
                 It maps the ideal working heart rate for a particular user and generates a playlist of songs with that BPM.
                  There are a variety of options for users to best tailor their playlists for their goals.

                A user can select what type of playlist they want for their workout. 
                Each playlist has a unique method of mapping heart rate to song BPM for different types of workouts.
                For example the standard playlist has a warm up and cooldown period that arranges songs in ascending and descending BPM around a target heart rate.

              The user now selects how intense they want their workout, which will raise the BPM ceiling accordingly.
              They input their age and the app will determine their target heart rate parameters based on ideal working heart rate research done by the <a class="link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-heart-rate">Mayo Clinic</a>.
               Lastly they can specify exactly how long they want their playlist to be (20-180 minutes).

            After a few seconds, their playlist is generated. 
            The app also creates the playlist in the user's Spotify account so users can generate a playlist on one device and see the changes immediately across all their devices.
            The playlist is timestamped and appropriately named so it can be easily located by users who have generated many playlists with the app.
